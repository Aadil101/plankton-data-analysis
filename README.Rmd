## Question-1. 

- Is maximum-likelihood estimator $\tilde{\sigma}^2$ of $\sigma^2$ an unbiased estimator ? Verify your answer. Comment on the change of the value of $E(\tilde{\sigma}^2) - {\sigma}^2$ as $n$ goes to infinity.

## Question-2. 

- Consider the shear strength vs age relation using the propellant data. 

```{r}
prop<-read.table("https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/propellant.csv", header=T, sep=",")
shearS<-prop$ShearS
age<-prop$Age

plot(age, shearS, xlab = "Propellant Age (weeks)", ylab = "Shear S. (psi)", main = "Rocket Propellant")
fitted <- lm(shearS ~ age)

ageList <- seq(0,25,0.5)
cList <- predict(fitted, list(age = ageList), int = "c", level = 0.95)
pList <- predict(fitted, list(age = ageList), int = "p", level = 0.95)

matlines(ageList, pList, lty='solid' ,  col = "red")
shTest <- shearS^5 

library(MASS)
bc = boxcox(shTest ~ age)
lambda <- bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]
```

1 doesn't seem to be in the approximate CI, therefore Box-Cox 
method suggests a transformation with lambda = `r lambda`.

### Part (a) 
- Recalculate the coefficients of the fitted linear regression model using the vector equations we obtained. 

```{r}
prop<-read.table("https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/propellant.csv", header=T, sep=",")
ShearS<-prop$ShearS
Age<-prop$Age

c=rep(1,length(Age))
x<-cbind(c,Age)
b_hat = solve((t(x) %*% x)) %*% t(x) %*% ShearS
```

beta0: `r b_hat[1]`

beta1: `r b_hat[2]`

### Part (b) 
- Suppose that the expectation of the initial shear strength is known to be 2400. 
Write the corresponding model (should involve only one parameter $\beta_1$). 
Calculate 95% CI on  $\beta_1$. 

```{r}
b1_hat_new = sum((ShearS-2400)*Age)/sum((Age)^2)
yhat = 2400 + b1_hat_new*Age
MSres = sum((ShearS - yhat)^2)/length(ShearS)
lower_lim = b1_hat_new - qt(0.975,length(ShearS)-1)*(MSres/sum(Age^2))^0.5
upper_lim = b1_hat_new + qt(0.975,length(ShearS)-1)*(MSres/sum(Age^2))^0.5
```

Confidence interval with initial shear strength set to 2400: (`r lower_lim`, `r upper_lim`)

## Example : Phytoplankton Population

- A scientist is trying to model the relation between phytoplankton population 
in the city public water supply and concentration of two substances. 
The sample data is at : 
https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/phytoplankton.csv

- where headers are 

  - pop : population of phytoplankton ($y$)
  - subs1 : concentration of substance-1  ($x_1$) 
  - subs2 : concentration of substance-2  ($x_2$)

- Lets consider a guessed model  
$$ y = 200 + 10x_1 -15x_2 $$
- Below is the corresponding code to plot the scatter diagram and the above plane. 

```{r}

# Note: Run the following in R console if you get errors in plotting or library loading : 
#  install.packages("scatterplot3d") 
#  install.packages("plot3D") 

library("plot3D")
library("scatterplot3d")

# Loading data 
pData <- read.table("https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/phytoplankton.csv", header=T, sep=",")
pop <- pData$pop
subs1 <- pData$subs1
subs2 <- pData$subs2

# Create a mesh
meshP <- mesh( seq(min(subs1),max(subs1),0.03)  , seq(min(subs2),max(subs2),0.03) )
x1Mesh <- meshP$x 
x2Mesh <- meshP$y 

myModel <- 200 + 10*x1Mesh  - 15 *x2Mesh   

# Below is the code to plot the scatter diagram with red markers and your model
# You need to set two variables before calling : 
# myModel : your model  
# PLOTTING # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
sc1 <- scatterplot3d(subs2,subs1,pop, pch=17 , type = 'p', angle = 15 , highlight.3d = T ) 
sc1$points3d (x2Mesh,x1Mesh, myModel, cex=.02, col="blue")


```


```{r}
# You can also change the view angle to visually test the model 
# PLOTTING # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
sc1 <- scatterplot3d(subs2,subs1,pop, pch=17 , type = 'p', angle = 125 , highlight.3d = T ) 
sc1$points3d (x2Mesh,x1Mesh, myModel, cex=.02, col="blue")

```

## Question-3

- For the phytoplankton population data use regression model of the form 
$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \varepsilon . $$
- Fit a multiple linear regression model (using (3.13) and hat matrix H). Plot scatter diagram and fitted plane.  Print predicted coefficients. 
- Calculate $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$.

```{r}
pData <- read.table("https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/phytoplankton.csv", header=T, sep=",")
pop <- pData$pop
subs1 <- pData$subs1
subs2 <- pData$subs2

c = rep(1,length(subs1))
x = cbind(c,subs1,subs2)
H = solve((t(x) %*% x)) %*% t(x)

b_hat = (H %*% pop)
```

beta0: `r b_hat[1]`

beta1: `r b_hat[2]`

beta2: `r b_hat[3]`

```{r}
meshP <- mesh( seq(min(subs1),max(subs1),0.03)  , seq(min(subs2),max(subs2),0.03) )
x1Mesh <- meshP$x 
x2Mesh <- meshP$y 
myModel <- b_hat[1] + b_hat[2]*x1Mesh + b_hat[3]*x2Mesh

sc1 <- scatterplot3d(subs2,subs1,pop, pch=17 , type = 'p', angle = 15 , highlight.3d = T ) 
sc1$points3d (x2Mesh,x1Mesh, myModel, cex=.02, col="blue")

yhat = b_hat[1] + b_hat[2]*subs1 + b_hat[3]*subs2
SSr = sum((yhat - mean(pop))^2)
SSres = sum((pop - yhat)^2)
SSt = sum((pop - mean(pop))^2)
Rsq = SSr/SSt
Rsq_adj = 1 - (SSres/(length(pop)-length(b_hat)))/(SSt/(length(pop)-1))
```

R-squared: `r Rsq`

R-squared-adjusted: `r Rsq_adj`

## Question-4

- This time use a more general model for the phytoplankton population data ;  
$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{11} x_{1}^2 + \beta_{22} x_2^2 + \beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \varepsilon. $$ 
- Fit a multiple linear regression model (using (3.13) and hat matrix H). Plot scatter diagram and fitted surface. Print predicted coefficients. 
- Calculate $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$. Compare with the previous model.

```{r}
pData <- read.table("https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m50f17/phytoplankton.csv", header=T, sep=",")
pop <- pData$pop
subs1 <- pData$subs1
subs2 <- pData$subs2

c = rep(1,length(subs1))
x = cbind(c,subs1,subs2,subs1^2,subs2^2,subs1*subs2)
H = solve((t(x) %*% x)) %*% t(x)

b_hat = H %*% pop
cat("beta0: ", b_hat[1],"\nbeta1: ",b_hat[2],"\nbeta2: ",b_hat[3],"\nbeta3: ",b_hat[4],"\nbeta4: " ,b_hat[5],"\nbeta5: " ,b_hat[6],"\n")

meshP <- mesh( seq(min(subs1),max(subs1),0.03)  , seq(min(subs2),max(subs2),0.03) )
x1Mesh <- meshP$x
x2Mesh <- meshP$y
myModel <- b_hat[1] + b_hat[2]*x1Mesh + b_hat[3]*x2Mesh + b_hat[4]*x1Mesh^2 + b_hat[5]*x2Mesh^2 + b_hat[6]*x1Mesh*x2Mesh

sc1 <- scatterplot3d(subs2,subs1,pop, pch=17 , type = 'p', angle = 15 , highlight.3d = T ) 
sc1$points3d (x2Mesh,x1Mesh, myModel, cex=.02, col="blue")

yhat = b_hat[1] + b_hat[2]*subs1 + b_hat[3]*subs2 + b_hat[4]*subs1^2 + b_hat[5]*subs2^2 + b_hat[6]*subs1*subs2
SSr = sum((yhat - mean(pop))^2)
SSres = sum((pop - yhat)^2)
SSt = sum((pop - mean(pop))^2)
Rsq = SSr/SSt
Rsq_adj = 1 - (SSres/(length(pop)-length(b_hat)))/(SSt/(length(pop)-1))
```

R-squared: `r Rsq`

R-squared-adjusted: `r Rsq_adj`

The $R^2$ found in Question-4 is far larger than the $R^2$ found in Question-3. The same relation is true when comparing the respective $R^2$-adjusted values. This means the model from Question-4 better approximates population than the model from Question-3 does.
